Timeout was used in this project.

It was used to decide when a sent UDP packet should be considered lost. Each packet is stored with the timestamp of when it was sent, and during every reporting interval the client checks how long each packet has been waiting for an ACK. If the waiting time exceeds the timeout value (which equals the reporting interval), the packet is marked as lost and removed from the pending list. This mechanism ensures that packets without ACKs are eventually counted as losses instead of waiting forever.
