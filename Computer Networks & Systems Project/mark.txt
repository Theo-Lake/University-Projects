Task 1
[/] Update the topology file and include all the nodes in the figure above.
[/] Configure the network interfaces and IP addresses for every node.
[/] Configure static routes for all hosts and routers.
[/] Configure link characteristics (bandwidth, delay, packet loss) based on the specifications in the Figure above.
[/] Ensure all hosts can communicate with each other.
Task 2
[/] Implement a client function (`tester_tcp_client()`) in the `net-tester.py` file that connects to a TCP server and continuously transmits data for bandwidth testing.
[/] Implement a server (`tester_tcp_server()`) function in the `net-tester.py` file that listens for incoming TCP connections and receives data from clients. The server *should* handle multiple clients simultaneously.
[/] Report the estimated bandwidth at regular intervals during the test on the client using the provided `Stat` class.
[/] Support the command-line arguments specified above to configure test parameters.
Task 3
[/] Implement the function `udp_tester_client()` to send datagrams at a specified rate from the client.
[/] Implement the function `udp_tester_server()` which creates a UDP server measuring network performance. 
[/] The function `udp_tester_server()` should calculate the bandwidth, jitter and packet loss metrics and report then at regular user-defined intervals using the provided `Logger` class.
[/] Support measurement with multiple parallel clients.
[/] Support the command-line arguments specified above to configure the test parameters.
Task 4
[/] Extend `udp_tester_server()` and implement code that sends ACKs (datagram ID echoed) when -a is enabled.
[/] Extend `udp_tester_client()` to compute bandwidth, jitter and packet loss from acknowledged packets and report then at regular user-defined intervals using the provided `Logger` class.
[/] Your implementation ignores duplicate IDs from server.
[/] Handle KeyboardInterrupt gracefully to print final stats.
